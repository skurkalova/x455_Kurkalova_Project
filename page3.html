                    <p>
                      The answer is really ambiguous because there are no “set”
                      tools. Anything could be a tool for polymer clay. Anything
                      like toothbrushes, nail art brushes, dental tools,
                      sandpaper, etc. Whatever would make an imprint on clay!
                      There are specialized tools out there designed for
                      “polymer clay” but some of them tend to be expensive and
                      overpriced. I’ve found that most of the tools at home are
                      good enough for my clay pieces. That being said, there’s
                      nothing wrong with using “polymer clay” tools either; some
                      of them are convenient. You just have to make sure that
                      the tools you’re using are ONLY for polymer clay. Polymer
                      clay tools can be divided into two categories, in my
                      opinion, “easy-to-get” tools and “specialized” tools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The “easy-to-get” tools are the tools you have available
                      and/or the “unconventional” tools. Like I mentioned
                      earlier, toothbrushes and sandpaper are really effective
                      for a gritty texture. Nail art brushes, sticks, and
                      dotting tools are really good for smaller details. Even
                      toothpicks are great for pressing small details into the
                      base of a design; for example, leaves or rosebuds around a
                      flower. Even for baking, there are “easy-to-get” tools. I
                      use ceramic tiles to bake my polymer clay, sometimes with
                      a baking sheet or paper in between. Ceramic tiles -
                      anything less than 5x5” - are cheap to get at the store
                      and can survive in the oven. They’re just hot to the touch
                      when they come out of the oven, so be sure to use gloves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As for the specialized tools for polymer clay, I find that
                      local businesses are the best way to go. A lot of polymer
                      clay artists have 3D printers and also sell
                      cutters/stencils and texture rollers for other artists.
                      You can find almost any cutter/roller design and create
                      your own spin on the design with it. For example, I love
                      doing floral designs for my jewelry, but replicating the
                      exact design multiple times by hand is really hard. So,
                      instead, I use the help of a cutter that makes seven
                      little petals at once and put them together by hand. It
                      makes the process easier.

                  </div>
                  <div class="my-scrolling">
                    <p>
                      Most of what makes a design good or bad is subjective.
                      Every polymer clay artist has their own style and design
                      preferences. What I make and design might not appeal to
                      some and that’s okay; there are lots of jewelry artists
                      out there. However, size and structural integrity can make
                      or break a polymer clay piece. Polymer clay is pretty
                      durable, if baked correctly, but the thinner the piece,
                      the more likely it is to break.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One thing that can lead to a bad polymer clay design is
                      not cleaning your tools. Polymer clay can get stuck in the
                      tiny corners of your tools and transfer. For example, red
                      polymer clay easily stains fingers and surfaces. Handling
                      white polymer clay after using the red one might not be
                      the best idea unless you wash your hands or change your
                      gloves. I’ve had moments where I thought I cleaned my
                      rolled and then discovered blue specs as I’m conditioning
                      the yellow clay. It’s not the end of the world when it
                      happens, but it can get annoying.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another thing that can lead to a bad polymer clay design
                      is baking incorrectly. Nothing hurts worse when you’ve
                      assembled the most beautiful piece, baked it in the oven,
                      and taken out a swollen, burnt husk because you’ve left it
                      in too long. Baking polymer clay is tricky since it is
                      sensitive to temperature changes and length of time. It’s
                      good practice to read the polymer clay packaging to know
                      the temperature and length of time per ¼ inch of clay. Not
                      all polymer clay brands are the same and they each have
                      their own set of rules. Underbaked clay will snap and
                      crumble, whereas overbaked clay will blacken and swell. I
                      have experienced both.
                    </p>

                      Resin is also another monster when it comes to designing
                      polymer clay jewelry. I have not used resin but it’s
                      popular for adding a shiny finish to polymer clay. If you
                      thought polymer clay was a hassle to use, resin is even
                      more so. It’s toxic to the touch - gloves are essential
                      and it’s generally recommended to wear a gas mask when
                      using it.
