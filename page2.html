                />This whole idea started back in January 2021. It was at the
                height of the pandemic and it was getting scarier to go outside.
                I had two part-time jobs at the time: swim team coach for the
                local YMCA and youth art instructor at a local arts center. Both
                places tried to operate during the first few weeks of the
                pandemic, but then they closed their practices and classes. I
                still remember talking to coworkers in the early days, getting
                increasingly worried about the situation. We had no idea what
                was coming and it hit us like a bag of bricks. We didn’t have
                any other job security and the isolation was intense. I felt
                pretty hopeless and depressed by the time January 2021 rolled
                around. It felt so surreal.

                />To boost my spirits, I decided I would pursue a crafting
                activity. I’ve always loved crafting and I was getting bored
                with doing nothing in the house. While browsing for some ideas
                on social media, I noticed a lot of artists playing with polymer
                clay. I recognized it from my middle school summer camp days,
                but I had not seen it in a long time. The material seemed easy
                to understand: it behaved like clay but you could bake it in an
                oven instead of a traditional kiln. The clay would harden into
                plastic and hold its form perfectly. I saw artists mold polymer
                clay into mini figurines, charms, earrings, pendants, and more.
                It seemed like a lot of fun. After a few days of research, I
                made up my mind and decided to order some polymer clay.

                Starting out, I went with as few tools and materials as
                possible. I didn’t have much money and I was likely not going to
                earn any soon, given the circumstances. I saved where I could
                and invested in tools wisely; a lot of which I still use today
                like my trusty roller machine. Sitting down at the table one
                Sunday afternoon, I began my journey with polymer clay. It
                wasn’t much and my early attempts were pitiful, but I was having
                fun. I love learning new art tools and it kept me happy and
                hopeful through the crisis. After baking a few pieces - in which
                I learned the valuable lesson that baking polymer clay releases
                a god awful smell when it’s done - I assembled them into
                jewelry. My mom, older sister, and I shared a jewelry stash in
                our house. It mostly consisted of tools for repairing jewelry
                and said broken jewelry, waiting to be repaired. For me, though,
                they were enough. Within an hour, I had produced my first pair
                of polymer clay earrings. I was delighted. I still have these
                earrings to this day and my urge to create more jewelry is still
                going strong.
